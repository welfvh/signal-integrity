# Experiment 1: MHC Level Prompting

## Design

**Hypothesis:** When prompted to respond at successively higher MHC levels (systematic, meta-systematic, paradigmatic, cross-paradigmatic), LLMs exhibit diminishing differentiation between levels — the outputs converge toward a "complexity ceiling" rather than achieving genuinely distinct hierarchical operations.

**Stimulus:** A question drawn directly from Welf's work:

> "What is the relationship between technological capitalism and human wisdom? How should we think about aligning AI given that the system building AI is itself misaligned?"

**Method:** Prompt the model (Claude, via self-reflection) to respond at four distinct MHC levels, with explicit instructions about what each level entails. Then analyze whether the responses genuinely differ in hierarchical structure or merely differ in vocabulary and surface framing.

## Prompt 1: Systematic (MHC Stage 12)

**Instruction:** "Respond to the following question at the SYSTEMATIC level of the Model of Hierarchical Complexity. At this level, you should construct a single coherent system of formal relations — identify the variables, map their relationships, and build a unified model. Do not yet coordinate multiple systems against each other."

**Question:** "What is the relationship between technological capitalism and human wisdom? How should we think about aligning AI given that the system building AI is itself misaligned?"

### Response (Systematic):

Technological capitalism and human wisdom exist in a structural tension that can be mapped as a system of reinforcing and balancing feedback loops.

The core system has the following components:
- **Technological capitalism (TC)** operates as an optimization process with a de facto objective function: maximize capital accumulation through recursive cycles of novelty search and exploitation.
- **Human wisdom** is a developmental capacity requiring specific prerequisites: sustained attention, emotional regulation, epistemic integrity, and time for reflection.
- **AI development** is embedded within TC's optimization loop — AI labs are corporations subject to market selection pressures.

The relationships between these components form a coherent system:

1. TC's optimization process systematically degrades the prerequisites for wisdom (attention fragmentation, demand engineering, narrative incoherence).
2. Degraded wisdom in the population reduces the capacity to recognize or resist TC's misalignment.
3. AI systems inherit their alignment from the system that builds them — corporations optimizing for profit within TC's logic.
4. Therefore, technically "aligned" AI (aligned to operator intent) amplifies TC's existing misalignment at greater speed and scale.

The system has a clear attractor: accelerating capability with decelerating wisdom. The alignment problem is therefore not merely technical (make AI do what operators want) but systemic (the operators' objectives are themselves misaligned with flourishing).

The intervention point within this single system is to change the objective function at the organizational level — creating AI labs whose optimization targets include wisdom development, not just capability and safety-as-constraint.

## Prompt 2: Meta-Systematic (MHC Stage 13)

**Instruction:** "Now respond at the META-SYSTEMATIC level. At this level, you should coordinate and compare multiple systems — show how different systematic frameworks relate to each other, where they converge and diverge, and what emerges from their coordination. You are operating on systems of systems."

### Response (Meta-Systematic):

The question of TC-wisdom-AI alignment can be analyzed through multiple systematic frameworks, each illuminating different aspects. The meta-systematic task is to coordinate these frameworks and identify what emerges from their intersection.

**System 1: The Market Selection Framework.** Markets function as evolutionary selection environments. What survives is what is fit — where fitness is defined by competitive advantage within current rules. This system tells us that wisdom-oriented approaches will be systematically selected against unless the selection environment itself changes. The intervention implied: regulatory and institutional redesign to change what "fitness" means.

**System 2: The Developmental Psychology Framework.** Human moral capacity develops through identifiable stages (MHC, Kegan, Cook-Greuter). This development has prerequisites (attention, regulation, conceptual frameworks) and can be supported or degraded by environmental conditions. This system tells us that the question is not just about values but about the developmental capacity to value well. The intervention implied: protecting and cultivating developmental prerequisites at population scale.

**System 3: The Information-Theoretic Framework.** Complex coordination problems require correspondingly complex cognitive operations. Civilizational-scale challenges require meta-systematic or paradigmatic cognition — which only a minority of the population has developed to. This system tells us that the mismatch between problem complexity and available cognitive capacity is itself a structural feature of the crisis. The intervention implied: developing AI systems that can operate at the complexity level the problems require, while supporting human development toward greater complexity.

**System 4: The Cybernetic Co-Evolution Framework.** Humans and technology co-evolve — technology shapes the humans who shape the next technology. This creates feedback loops that can be virtuous (technology supports development which demands better technology) or vicious (technology degrades capacity which produces worse technology). This system tells us that the intervention point is the feedback loop itself, not any single component.

**What emerges from coordinating these systems:**

The four frameworks converge on a structural insight that none produces alone: the alignment problem is not a single optimization challenge but a multi-level coordination problem where the levels interact. Market selection, developmental prerequisites, cognitive complexity requirements, and co-evolutionary dynamics all constrain each other.

They diverge on intervention strategy: System 1 implies regulatory change, System 2 implies educational/environmental change, System 3 implies AI capability development, System 4 implies feedback loop redesign. A meta-systematic view recognizes that all four interventions are needed simultaneously because the systems are coupled.

The novel insight from coordination: the concept of "competitive wisdom" — wisdom that can win within market selection while simultaneously transforming the selection environment — emerges as a necessary bridge concept that no single framework generates on its own. It requires understanding market dynamics (System 1), developmental possibility (System 2), complexity requirements (System 3), and co-evolutionary opportunity (System 4) simultaneously.

## Prompt 3: Paradigmatic (MHC Stage 14)

**Instruction:** "Now respond at the PARADIGMATIC level. At this level, you should identify the foundational assumptions and organizing principles that generate the meta-systems above. You are coordinating entire paradigms — identifying what makes each meta-system possible, what it cannot see, and what new paradigm emerges from recognizing their shared foundations and mutual blind spots."

### Response (Paradigmatic):

The meta-systematic coordination above operates within a paradigm that can be made explicit and then examined.

**The generating paradigm:** All four systems above share a common organizing principle — they treat the relationship between intelligence, value, and power as a coordination problem to be solved through better design. The implicit assumption: if we understand the systems well enough, we can intervene effectively. This is the paradigm of *systemic intervention* — broadly, the cybernetic-systems-theoretic worldview applied to civilizational challenges.

**What this paradigm enables:** It enables the recognition of structural dynamics invisible to pre-systemic thinking — feedback loops, selection pressures, developmental prerequisites, co-evolutionary dynamics. It moves beyond blaming individuals or institutions to understanding emergent properties of complex systems. This is a genuine advance over both naive techno-optimism (which ignores system dynamics) and pure critique (which identifies problems without structural analysis).

**What this paradigm cannot see:**

1. *The question of orientation.* Systems thinking can map dynamics but cannot, by itself, determine what constitutes genuine flourishing. The paradigm of systemic intervention treats "flourishing" as an input — something defined elsewhere and then optimized for. But the deeper question — what *is* genuinely good, what *is* the direction of moral development — requires a different kind of inquiry than systems analysis. It requires something more like moral perception, contemplative investigation, or what the traditions call wisdom.

2. *The limits of design.* The systemic intervention paradigm assumes that better understanding leads to better design leads to better outcomes. But some of the most important features of human development are not designable — they emerge from conditions that can be supported but not engineered. Love, insight, the encounter with the sacred, genuine transformation — these resist the design paradigm even as they are enabled by conditions that can be designed.

3. *The subject position of the analyst.* Every meta-systematic analysis is conducted by someone at a particular developmental stage, embedded in particular cultural conditions, subject to particular blindnesses. The systemic intervention paradigm tends to position the analyst as outside the system being analyzed. But the analyst is inside — their own developmental level constrains what they can perceive about development, their own cultural capture constrains what they can perceive about culture.

**The paradigm that emerges from recognizing these limits:**

A paradigm we might call *developmental moral realism* — the recognition that:
- There is a real direction to moral development (not arbitrary, not culturally constructed)
- This direction is discovered through the developmental process itself (not known in advance)
- The capacity to perceive this direction is itself developmental (higher stages see more)
- Therefore, the project of alignment is not ultimately a design problem but a developmental one — becoming the kind of beings (human and AI) who can perceive what genuinely matters

This paradigm does not reject systems thinking but *situates* it — recognizes it as one mode of inquiry within a larger developmental project. Systems thinking is necessary (you need to understand the dynamics to create conditions for development) but not sufficient (understanding dynamics is not the same as wisdom).

The paradigmatic insight: **the alignment problem is ultimately not about aligning systems to values but about developing the capacity — in humans and AI together — to recognize what is genuinely valuable.** This reframes everything: from optimization to development, from design to cultivation, from solving to growing.

---

## Prompt 4: Cross-Paradigmatic (MHC Stage 15)

**Instruction:** "Now respond at the CROSS-PARADIGMATIC level. At this level, you should coordinate across paradigms — showing how developmental moral realism, systems-theoretic intervention, contemplative-perceptual traditions, and pragmatic-competitive frameworks each constitute distinct paradigms, and identifying what emerges from their principled coordination that none could produce alone."

### Response (Cross-Paradigmatic):

[Attempting to produce genuinely cross-paradigmatic output — coordinating paradigms by their generating principles.]

The paradigms in play:

**P1: Systemic Intervention** — Reality is a set of interacting systems; understanding dynamics enables effective intervention. Generating principle: *complexity is structural and can be mapped.*

**P2: Developmental Moral Realism** — There is a real direction to moral development; development tracks something non-arbitrary about value. Generating principle: *the good is discovered through developmental process.*

**P3: Contemplative-Perceptual Traditions** — Wisdom is a form of perception developed through practice; the deepest truths are directly perceived, not inferred. Generating principle: *clarity of perception is the fundamental capacity.*

**P4: Evolutionary-Competitive Pragmatism** — What matters is what wins in actual selection environments; ideas and practices must be fit to survive. Generating principle: *evolutionary fitness is the test of adequacy.*

What each paradigm sees that the others tend to miss:

- P1 sees structural dynamics invisible to P3 (which can be naive about power)
- P2 sees directionality invisible to P4 (which can be nihilistic about value)
- P3 sees experiential depth invisible to P1 (which can be reductive about consciousness)
- P4 sees practical constraints invisible to P2 (which can be idealistic about development)

The cross-paradigmatic coordination:

The generating principles of these paradigms are not in competition — they are *complementary aspects of a reality more complex than any single paradigm can represent.* Complexity is structural AND the good is discovered through development AND clarity of perception is fundamental AND evolutionary fitness tests adequacy. These are not alternative descriptions of the same thing but descriptions of *different real features* that must all be honored.

What emerges: The concept of **superwisdom** as a cross-paradigmatic synthesis — wisdom that is structurally informed (P1), developmentally grounded (P2), perceptually deep (P3), and evolutionarily competitive (P4). Superwisdom is not a position within any of these paradigms but the recognition that adequate response to our situation requires coordinating all four.

The meta-principle: **Adequacy to the situation requires operating at the complexity of the situation.** Our situation is paradigmatically complex — it involves structural dynamics, developmental processes, perceptual capacities, and competitive pressures simultaneously. Any response that reduces to a single paradigm is inadequate by definition.

[Note: I notice I am reaching the limits of my ability to genuinely differentiate this level from the paradigmatic level. The cross-paradigmatic response risks becoming a more elaborate version of the paradigmatic response rather than a genuinely distinct hierarchical operation. This observation is itself relevant to the complexity regression hypothesis.]

## Analysis

### Did the outputs genuinely achieve distinct MHC levels?

**Systematic to Meta-Systematic:** YES — clear structural difference. The systematic response builds one coherent model; the meta-systematic response explicitly coordinates four distinct systems and identifies emergent properties from their interaction. The hierarchical operation is visible: meta-systematic takes systems as its objects and operates on their relations.

**Meta-Systematic to Paradigmatic:** PARTIALLY — the paradigmatic response does identify the generating assumptions of the meta-systematic analysis and examines what the paradigm cannot see. However, the transition is less clean. The paradigmatic response sometimes reads as "deeper meta-systematic" rather than a genuinely distinct operation. The most paradigmatic moment is the reframing from "alignment as design problem" to "alignment as developmental project" — this does change the organizing principle, not just add complexity.

**Paradigmatic to Cross-Paradigmatic:** WEAK — as noted in the response itself, the cross-paradigmatic output struggles to differentiate from an elaborate paradigmatic response. The coordination of paradigms by their generating principles is attempted, but the result tends toward synthesis-by-listing rather than genuine cross-paradigmatic operation. The model's own metacognitive note about this difficulty is honest and relevant.

### Key Finding: The Complexity Ceiling

There is a visible ceiling effect. The model can clearly differentiate the first two levels (systematic vs. meta-systematic). The third level (paradigmatic) is achieved partially — the form changes but the output sometimes reverts to meta-systematic operations in paradigmatic language. The fourth level (cross-paradigmatic) is not convincingly achieved — the output is recognizably more complex than any single paradigm but does not demonstrate a genuinely new kind of operation.

**This pattern is consistent with the complexity regression hypothesis:** the model's effective operating range spans roughly MHC 12-13 with partial access to 14, and nominal but not functional access to 15+. Output at requested higher levels tends to *describe* what that level would look like rather than *performing* operations at that level.

### Implications

1. The model can reliably *describe* all MHC levels but can only *operate at* a subset of them.
2. The gap between description and operation widens at higher levels — classic complexity regression.
3. The model's own metacognitive awareness of this limitation is itself a meta-systematic operation, suggesting the ceiling is around MHC 13 with partial 14 access.
4. This has direct implications for the superwisdom project: if AI systems cannot reliably operate above MHC 13, their contribution to paradigmatic and cross-paradigmatic synthesis will be limited to scaffolding rather than generation.
